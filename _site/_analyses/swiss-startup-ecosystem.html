<h2 id="1-ai-trends-for-startups-google-clouds-2025-report">1. AI Trends for Startups (Google Cloud’s 2025 Report)</h2>

<p><img src="ai-wave.jpg" alt="AI Agents Concept" height="400" /></p>

<p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI) Momentum</strong> — Startups are the <strong>engine of GenAI innovation</strong> in 2025, rapidly creating new applications and business models. <em>Google Cloud’s “Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups 2025”</em> gathered insights from 23 AI leaders to chart this path. Key themes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rise of AI Agents</strong> — An <mark>“agentic AI” movement</mark> is underway. Unlike simple chatbots, AI agents can make decisions, execute tasks, and act autonomously. Experts predict AI agents evolving from task-specific helpers to <mark>“ambient agents”</mark>, always-on digital assistants that proactively handle background tasks.<br />
👉 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/transform/future-of-ai-for-startups-23-industry-leaders-survey#:~:text=personalized%20guidance%20that%20feels%20more,human%20than%20mechanical">Read: What’s next in AI for startups | Google Cloud Blog</a><br />
For example, Harrison Chase (LangChain CEO) envisions agents monitoring events and only alerting humans when intervention is needed.<br />
👉 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/transform/future-of-ai-for-startups-23-industry-leaders-survey#:~:text=personalized%20guidance%20that%20feels%20more,human%20than%20mechanical">See quote from LangChain CEO</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="new">
  <p><strong>New:</strong> This shift marks a fundamental evolution in AI usage — from reactive tools to proactive collaborators.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Ambient agents may redefine how humans interact with software, shifting from task-execution to delegation and trust in autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> — Next-gen AI will better understand <strong>human emotions and intent</strong>. <strong>Matthieu Rouif</strong> (Photoroom) and <strong>Jia Li</strong> (LiveX AI) foresee AI tailoring content to user emotions and truly grasping customer intent – making interactions feel “more human than mechanical.”</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notice">
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Emotional intelligence in AI is no longer a luxury — it’s becoming a product differentiator.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Infrastructure &amp; Integration</strong> — Breakthrough AI needs <strong>breakthrough infrastructure</strong>. With skyrocketing compute demands for AI models, startups must architect systems for flexibility and scale. <strong>Amin Vahdat</strong> (Google Cloud) notes <strong>“never-seen-before” compute density requirements, pushing modular model architectures and robust <em>observability</em>. Startups should plan for **plug-and-play model upgrades</strong> to avoid constant overhauls.<br />
<em>Key insight:</em> Building AI into real business workflows, with strong observability and A/B testing vs. existing processes, is vital (per <strong>Mayada Gonimah</strong>, Thread AI CTO).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Infrastructure is not just a backend concern — it’s a strategic moat for long-term scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Investor Priorities</strong> — In 2025, VCs and angels refocus on <strong>AI startups solving concrete problems</strong>. <em>No more “AI-for-AI’s sake”</em>: Investors seek <strong>applied AI</strong> in health, climate, housing, etc. (<strong>Salim Teja</strong>, Radical Ventures). They value <strong>high-quality proprietary data</strong> moats, productivity gains (especially dev tools), and clear ROI over hype.<br />
<strong>Crystal Huang</strong> (GV) says: <em>“If your product is easy to implement, it’s just as easy to uninstall”</em> — meaning successful AI products must become <strong>indispensable, deeply integrated in workflows</strong>.<br />
In short, <em>“stickiness”</em> and path to profitability trump novelty.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notice">
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Investors in 2025 care more about traction and defensibility than technical elegance alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Competitive Moats</strong> — To <strong>leapfrog competition</strong>, startups need more than wrapping a generic LLM behind an interface. <strong>Yoav Shoham</strong> (AI21 Labs) urges teams to find “Product–Algo Fit” – leverage <strong>today’s best models</strong> in clever ways rather than waiting for future improvements.<br />
<strong>David Friedberg</strong> (Ohalo Genetics) warns against being just an “LLM wrapper” – sustainable AI ventures will have an <strong>“engine of value”</strong> like proprietary data or network effects that continuously improve the AI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Looking Ahead Responsibly</strong> — The <strong>GenAI revolution’s pace</strong> is unprecedented. Google Cloud’s report concludes with a call for <strong>responsible AI</strong> collaboration – ensuring infrastructure, tooling, and guidance keep up so startups can harness AI ethically and effectively.<br />
Founders are advised to capitalize on resources like cloud credits (up to $350k) and expert consultations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Speed must be matched with responsibility — ethics and governance will determine long-term viability in AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> — For Swiss AI startups (and their investors) in 2025, <strong>the bar is high</strong>: those who combine <strong>cutting-edge AI (agents, LLMs)</strong> with <strong>real-world utility</strong> and <strong>strong execution</strong> will lead. ETH Zurich’s talent pool and tech focus align well with these trends, helping local startups build responsibly and ambitiously.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Survival &amp; Scale</strong> — An <strong>incredible 93%</strong> of ETH spin-offs <strong>survive 5+ years</strong>, far exceeding typical startup rates. As of early 2025, ETH spin-offs total <strong>580+ companies since 1973</strong>, with 519 still active in Switzerland.<br />
This longevity underscores ETH’s supportive environment and strong founder preparation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> ETH’s spin-offs aren’t just numerous — they’re resilient. A 93% survival rate sets a global benchmark.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Funding Boom</strong> — ETH spin-offs raised <strong>CHF 425 M</strong> in 2024 (42 financing rounds) – a +25% jump YoY, and <strong>10x growth versus a decade ago</strong>. The report notes a <em>tenfold increase</em> in annual investment since 2014.<br />

Exits and unicorns provide <strong>capital recycling and alumni mentorship</strong>, fueling the ecosystem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="new">
  <p><strong>New:</strong> Exits and unicorns are not just success metrics — they feed back into ETH’s founder pipeline through mentorship, funding, and credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global yet Local</strong> — ETH spin-off founders are internationally diverse (46 nationalities since 2017; ~55% non-Swiss), but importantly <strong>&gt;99% of spin-offs stay in Switzerland</strong>.<br />
This “brain capture” reflects Switzerland’s attractiveness for business (IP rights, grants, quality of life).<br />
The ETH network helps foreign founders navigate incorporation and local growth, benefiting the Swiss economy through job creation and innovation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notice">
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> ETH retains global talent locally — a strategic advantage for Switzerland’s innovation economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Diversity Progress</strong> — Female founders are rising. In 2024, <strong>14% of spin-off founders were women</strong> and <strong>35% of new spin-offs had mixed-gender teams</strong>.<br />
While all-female founder teams remain rare, the trend of mixed teams is encouraging, showing ETH’s efforts (like <strong>Women in Tech</strong> initiatives) are gaining traction.<br />
The <strong>Student Project House</strong> and targeted programs help broaden participation.</p>
  </li>

Fewer spin-offs originate in purely theoretical fields (e.g., Math had the fewest).<br />
This suggests a strong link between <strong>applied research</strong> and entrepreneurship at ETH.<br />
On the industry side, <strong>AI/software</strong> and <strong>biotech/medtech</strong> dominate recent spin-offs, often converging (e.g., ETH AI in healthcare imaging).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Applied research isn’t just impactful — it’s the heartbeat of ETH’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong> — ETH Zurich’s spin-off engine combines world-class research, founder-friendly culture, and strong institutional backing – yielding startups that not only launch in record numbers but <em>thrive</em> and scale.<br />
For investors, ETH spin-offs represent <strong>de-risked, high-potential bets</strong> given their survival stats and deep IP; for founders, ETH offers a model launchpad with resources from lab to market.</p>

<h3 id="student-project-house-sph-makerspace--idea-accelerator">Student Project House (SPH): <em>Makerspace &amp; Idea Accelerator</em></h3>

<p>ETH’s <strong>Student Project House</strong> is a creativity lab open to all students – a <strong>sandbox to tinker and prototype</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Facilities</strong> — SPH offers <strong>makerspaces with advanced equipment</strong> (3D printers, laser cutters, electronics labs) and co-working areas.<br />
Students can get <strong>free access to build prototypes or hardware</strong> for their startup ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Seed Funding &amp; Coaching</strong> — SPH runs programs like <strong>Spark or Ignition Grants</strong> – small funds (CHF 5–10k) for early-stage student projects.<br />
They emphasize learning by doing, not equity or IP. Coaches (students or staff) also mentor teams on project management and design thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Community &amp; Events</strong> — Regular meetups, idea-pitch nights, and “Ask the Expert” sessions foster a maker community.<br />
Projects at SPH range from social impact tech to AI-driven gadgets.<br />
Teams can join SPH early, then graduate to RocketHub or apply to BOOST as they formalize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example Projects</strong> — A team developing water quality sensors (like <strong>Riverkin</strong>, mentioned in 2024 highlights) can prototype at SPH, get initial funding, and eventually spin out if viable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional-eth-resources">Additional ETH Resources</h3>

<p>ETH’s ecosystem extends further:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ETH Zurich Foundation &amp; Fundraising</strong> — Matches startups with industry sponsors or philanthropists (e.g., bridge grants, competition prizes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>IP &amp; Tech Transfer (ETH transfer)</strong> — A dedicated office helps spin-offs <strong>license ETH-owned IP</strong> and file patents. Critical for deeptech.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Entrepreneurship Courses</strong> — ETH offers lectures on startup topics, often with VC guest speakers or founder alumni. UZH collaborations deepen academic-industry engagement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Summary</strong> — At ETH, a student can <strong>ideate at SPH</strong>, <strong>validate in an EC hackathon</strong>, <strong>get early funding from jFund</strong>, <strong>incubate at RocketHub</strong>, <strong>accelerate via BOOST</strong>, and <strong>showcase at Launch</strong> – all within the campus network.<br />
This end-to-end support significantly de-risks startup formation and growth.<br />
For investors, ETH startups are often <strong>better prepared and vetted</strong>.<br />
For corporates, the ecosystem provides a <strong>steady stream of spin-outs for potential partnerships or acquisitions</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="4-funding-and-sector-overview">4. Funding and Sector Overview</h2>

<p><img src="funding.jpg" alt="Swiss Funding Landscape" height="400" /></p>

<p>Switzerland’s startup funding landscape in 2024–25 has seen <strong>mixed fortunes</strong> – a slight downturn in volume, but bright spots in certain sectors, especially <strong>AI and biotech</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="overall-funding-climate">Overall Funding Climate</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total Funding Decline</strong> — Swiss startups raised ~<strong>CHF 2.3 B in 2024</strong>, down ~15% from 2023. This marks the second year of decline from the 2021–2022 boom (2022 was ~CHF 3.9 B).<br />
Contributing factors:
    <ul>
      <li>Macro-economic tightening (higher interest rates, VC caution)</li>
      <li>Lack of mega-rounds (&gt;CHF 200 M); more conservative follow-ons</li>
      <li>However, <strong>H2 2024 showed slight recovery</strong> vs H1, hinting the bottom may be behind us</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notice">
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Despite macro pressures, the Swiss ecosystem is showing signs of stabilization — especially in H2 2024.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deal Count</strong> — <strong>513 funding rounds</strong> in 2024 (vs 550 in 2023, –6.7%). The decline was sharper in H2 (225 deals) compared to H1 (288), reflecting a summer slowdown. By early 2025, investors seem more optimistic, especially in high-tech verticals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Round Sizes</strong> — Fewer blockbuster rounds but healthy seed/Series A activity. A notable trend is many smaller AI startups getting funded.<br />
<em>Implication:</em> VCs spread bets in AI and biotech, while growth-stage funding is more scarce except for top performers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="sector-breakdown">Sector Breakdown</h3>

<p><strong>1. Health &amp; Biotech</strong></p>

<ul>
