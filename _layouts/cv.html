<!-- <div class="cv-container">
  <div class="cv-intro" style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.6; padding: 1em; border-left: 4px solid #4e73df;">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      I am a technical professional with exceptional academic credentials and proven industry experience, positioned at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and quantitative analysis. As a gold medalist graduating with the highest GPA (9.6/10) and Rank 1 from IIT Bombay, followed by pursuing an MSc in Computer Science (5.25/6 GPA) with Machine Intelligence specialization at ETH Zürich (QS #1 in Europe for CS), my academic trajectory demonstrates both intellectual capability and sustained excellence.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      This academic foundation is complemented by substantive professional experience including a successful tenure as a Data Scientist at AB InBev where I delivered $2.4M in annual savings through advanced time-series forecasting and optimization models, earning two company awards within my first year. My technical versatility is further evidenced through five diverse internships across tech, finance, and healthcare sectors—each culminating in full-time offers—and rigorous research contributions at ETH Zürich's Medical Data Science Group and Technology Innovation Management chair.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      Beyond technical proficiency, I bring exceptional communication abilities honed through international collaborations and recognized journalism work. As an IIT Bombay Journalism Color Award recipient (one of only two among 10,000+ students) and delegate to prestigious conferences including Harvard HPAIR and Princeton Business Today, I've demonstrated the ability to translate complex technical concepts across diverse audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unique combination of quantitative excellence and communication skills, validated through multiple merit scholarships (KC Mahindra, Heyning-Roelli, OPJEMS) and Mensa membership, positions me to not only architect sophisticated technical solutions but also effectively advocate for their business value—making me an ideal candidate for roles requiring both analytical depth and strategic thinking.
