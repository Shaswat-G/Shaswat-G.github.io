## Learning Approach

This course is designed around a learn-by-doing pedagogy:

```python
def learning_philosophy():
    concepts = ["theory", "examples", "practice", "projects"]
    knowledge = 0

    for concept in concepts:
        knowledge += apply(concept)
        if reflect_and_improve(knowledge):
            continue

    return mastery
```

## Who Should Enroll?

- CS students aiming for professional-grade Python skills
- Developers transitioning to Python from other languages
- Data scientists seeking stronger software engineering foundations
- Self-taught programmers filling gaps with structured rigor

---

## Special Features

- Elegant, concise notes optimized for quick reference
- Incremental, memory-efficient learning path
- Best practices embedded in every topic
- Engineering-first approach: explains not just _what_, but _why_ and _how_
