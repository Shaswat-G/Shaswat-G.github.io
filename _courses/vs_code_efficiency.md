## Why This Guide Exists

You're spending 8+ hours in your editor. Why crawl when you could fly?

This course transforms VS Code beginners into keyboard ninjas and helps intermediate users eliminate their last inefficient habits. We'll cover everything from basic navigation to advanced refactoring techniques that will make your pair-programming partners wonder if you've made a deal with a productivity devil.

## What You'll Learn

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Move through files, projects, and UI elements without touching the mouse
- **Multi-Cursor Editing**: Edit multiple lines simultaneously (feels like a superpower)
- **Refactoring Tools**: Rename variables across files with a few keystrokes
- **Terminal Integration**: Run commands without leaving your editor
- **Split Views**: Monitor multiple files side-by-side
- **Debugging Mastery**: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through codeâ€”all via keyboard
- **Extension Power-Ups**: Must-have extensions that amplify your productivity

## Prerequisites

- VS Code installed
- Basic familiarity with coding
- Willingness to be temporarily slower while you build muscle memory (trust the process)

## Course Structure

## The Learning Curve

Remember, there's a brief productivity dip when switching to keyboard-centric workflows. It's normal. The payoff is enormous when your fingers start moving at the speed of thought.

As one student put it: "My coworkers now think I'm a wizard. I don't correct them."
