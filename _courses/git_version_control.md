- Maintain a clean, meaningful project history
- Collaborate effectively with other developers
- Manage complex features without code conflicts

## What's Inside

Five carefully structured learning modules with practical applications:

- **Getting Started** - Installation, configuration, and version control fundamentals
- **Creating Snapshots** - Strategic commits, .gitignore management, and staging workflows
- **Browsing History** - Searching logs, comparing changes, and tracking code evolution
- **Branch, Merge & Conflict** - Parallel development techniques and clean conflict resolution
- **Collaboration** - Remote repositories, pull requests, and team workflow integration

## Thoughtfully Designed Resources

This isn't just documentation—it's a complete learning system:

- **Comprehensive Notes** - Clear explanations with practical examples in each module
- **Reference Cheat Sheet** - Essential commands organized by workflow context
- **Visual Mind Map** - Connecting concepts to strengthen your mental model of Git

## Learn Your Way

Whether you're new to development or looking to refine your skills:

1. Follow the structured path from basics to advanced techniques
2. Jump to specific modules to address immediate challenges
3. Keep the cheat sheet handy during your daily work
4. Revisit the mind map to reinforce how concepts interconnect

## Practical Value
