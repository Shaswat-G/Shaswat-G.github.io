## 1. AI Trends for Startups (Google Cloud’s 2025 Report)

![AI Agents Concept](ai-wave.jpg){:height="400"}

**Generative AI (GenAI) Momentum** — Startups are the **engine of GenAI innovation** in 2025, rapidly creating new applications and business models. _Google Cloud’s “Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups 2025”_ gathered insights from 23 AI leaders to chart this path. Key themes include:

- **Rise of AI Agents** — An <mark>“agentic AI” movement</mark> is underway. Unlike simple chatbots, AI agents can make decisions, execute tasks, and act autonomously. Experts predict AI agents evolving from task-specific helpers to <mark>“ambient agents”</mark>, always-on digital assistants that proactively handle background tasks.  
  👉 [Read: What's next in AI for startups | Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/transform/future-of-ai-for-startups-23-industry-leaders-survey#:~:text=personalized%20guidance%20that%20feels%20more,human%20than%20mechanical)  
  For example, Harrison Chase (LangChain CEO) envisions agents monitoring events and only alerting humans when intervention is needed.  
  👉 [See quote from LangChain CEO](https://cloud.google.com/transform/future-of-ai-for-startups-23-industry-leaders-survey#:~:text=personalized%20guidance%20that%20feels%20more,human%20than%20mechanical)

> **New:** This shift marks a fundamental evolution in AI usage — from reactive tools to proactive collaborators.  
{: .new}

> **Important:** Ambient agents may redefine how humans interact with software, shifting from task-execution to delegation and trust in autonomy.  
{: .important}

With skyrocketing compute demands for AI models, startups must architect systems for flexibility and scale. **Amin Vahdat** (Google Cloud) notes **“never-seen-before” compute density requirements, pushing modular model architectures and robust _observability_. Startups should plan for **plug-and-play model upgrades** to avoid constant overhauls.  
  _Key insight:_ Building AI into real business workflows, with strong observability and A/B testing vs. existing processes, is vital (per **Mayada Gonimah**, Thread AI CTO).

> **Important:** Infrastructure is not just a backend concern — it’s a strategic moat for long-term scale.  
{: .important}

- **Investor Priorities** — In 2025, VCs and angels refocus on **AI startups solving concrete problems**. _No more “AI-for-AI’s sake”_: Investors seek **applied AI** in health, climate, housing, etc. (**Salim Teja**, Radical Ventures). They value **high-quality proprietary data** moats, productivity gains (especially dev tools), and clear ROI over hype.  
  **Crystal Huang** (GV) says: _“If your product is easy to implement, it’s just as easy to uninstall”_ — meaning successful AI products must become **indispensable, deeply integrated in workflows**.  
  In short, _“stickiness”_ and path to profitability trump novelty.

> **Notice:** Investors in 2025 care more about traction and defensibility than technical elegance alone.  
{: .notice}

- **Competitive Moats** — To **leapfrog competition**, startups need more than wrapping a generic LLM behind an interface. **Yoav Shoham** (AI21 Labs) urges teams to find “Product–Algo Fit” – leverage **today’s best models** in clever ways rather than waiting for future improvements.  
  **David Friedberg** (Ohalo Genetics) warns against being just an “LLM wrapper” – sustainable AI ventures will have an **“engine of value”** like proprietary data or network effects that continuously improve the AI.

- **Looking Ahead Responsibly** — The **GenAI revolution’s pace** is unprecedented. Google Cloud’s report concludes with a call for **responsible AI** collaboration – ensuring infrastructure, tooling, and guidance keep up so startups can harness AI ethically and effectively.  
  Founders are advised to capitalize on resources like cloud credits (up to $350k) and expert consultations.

> **Important:** Speed must be matched with responsibility — ethics and governance will determine long-term viability in AI.  
{: .important}

**Takeaway** — For Swiss AI startups (and their investors) in 2025, **the bar is high**: those who combine **cutting-edge AI (agents, LLMs)** with **real-world utility** and **strong execution** will lead. ETH Zurich’s talent pool and tech focus align well with these trends, helping local startups build responsibly and ambitiously.
